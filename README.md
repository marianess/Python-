This exercise was complited duting one of the Python CodeClub sessions at the Tallinn University of Technology. 
It is pretty obvious that MS Word counts words in text for you, but way more cool is to try yourself out and write a script that does the same. 
This Python script counts amount of words, lines and empty lines in text.
Just as example, file "1.txt" is added to the project, so in case you want to test the script on other txt files just change the three last lines of the code where functions are called.
